Wall Street Journal analysis of draft peace treaty:

- Ukraine would be allowed to seek EU membership  
- would not be allowed to join military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). 

- foreign weapons would not be allowed on the territory of Ukraine. (!!)
- Ukraine's Armed Forces would be reduced to a certain size:
	- Moscow wanted the strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not to exceed 85,000 military personnel, 342 tanks, and 519 artillery systems. 
	- The document indicates that, during the negotiations, the Ukrainian side demanded 250,000 military personnel, 800 tanks, and 1,900 artillery systems.
	- Russia wanted the range of Ukrainian missiles to be limited to 40 kilometres. 

- The Crimean peninsula would remain under Moscow's influence and would not be considered neutral. 
- The future of Ukraine’s east, part of which was occupied by Russia in 2014, was not included in the draft
- the Russian language should function equally as Ukrainian in government and courts.
- The treaty was to be guaranteed by foreign powers, among which the document listed the United States, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia. These countries would be obliged to defend Ukraine's neutrality in case of a breach of the treaty.
- While the treaty would be in force, the document said, the guarantor countries would be obliged to "terminate international treaties and agreements, incompatible with the permanent neutrality of Ukraine," including any promises of bilateral military assistance(!!). International security guarantees would not apply to Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.
- The draft treaty with Ukraine provided for the prohibition of foreign weapons, "including missile weapons of any type, armed forces and formations."

Russia wanted all guarantor states to agree on a response (!!), meaning that a unified response would be unlikely if Russia itself was the aggressor.

Russia wanted Kyiv to withdraw claims to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes war crimes.

Russia requested the lifting of all mutual sanctions.
