Summary:

- things are a lot closer than they appear
- Russia built the wrong kind of military for this war
- If the West wants to win it can

If the goal was to disrupt communication, decapitate Ukrainian leadership and achieve victory before western sanctions and weapons deliveries arrive, what would you need:

- high quality command and control, intelligence,
- SEAD suppression of enemy air defence - air superiority
- close air support + precision guided munitions
- elite light forces

Where did the Russian defence budget go?

- nuclear capabilities (huge war head count, legacy arsenal + modernisation); nuclear programs are extremely expensive, relevance in the war against Ukraine: minimal
- navy - large legacy navy from the Soviet Union and new vessels, relevance: minimal
- internal security: rosgvardia - 300k employees
- Wunderwaffen: hypersonics SU-57, modern armoured vehicles T-14, doomsday weapons, huge r&d spending - procurement numbers is low
- Huge stock of legacy systems not built for this war + conscription, conscripted soldiers low training, low morale

Russia invested in stuff that is not useful for this war.

Ukrainian Forces

Since 2014 reforms. Every dollar spent in Ukraine is invested to defend Ukraine. No Wunderwaffen. Western forces provide intelligence which is basically free intelligence.
Troops that can be deployed is not so asymmetric as you would think.


The West wants it can provide so much military aid that it would exceed Russian military budget by a lot.

"Ukraine has achieved operational successes that people did not anticipate. Russia has limited offensive potential and won't so long as Ukraine continues to be supplied by it's western partners, which is a big 'if'."
(...)
"In longer wars economic potential translates into denying the adversary's logistics and supplying your side. The economic preponderance that the West has over Russia is enormous. It should be easy for us to supply Ukraine, yet we have been slow but getting there."
(...)
"Even if USA supplemental doesn't pass even the EU + UK alone can substantially outmatch Russia."
